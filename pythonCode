## This program allows the user to ascertain accumulated interest from an investment, or the monthly repayment on a housing mortgage.
## User will have to input a selection between 'investment' or 'bond'
## If statements are used based on the user's inputs, and a while loop checks for invalid inputs

# This while loop checks for 'investment' or 'bond' as valid inputs, and then allows the program to run further if valid.
